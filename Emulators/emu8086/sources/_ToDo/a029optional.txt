it can be,
we use mid() function to 
parse strings instead of 
accesing characters directly
with () 

this is how it works in
 vb.net 2010 express:

' * * * * * * * * * *
'this should print 'c'
dim s as String
s= "abc"
Debug.print ("direct access: " & s(2))
Debug.print ("mid access: " & mid(s,3,1))
' * * * * * * * * * *

perhaps in vb 5/6
characters can be accessed in 
the similar way too.

note () for Debug.print aren't
required for vb 5/6
