\section{Introduction}
A short introduction to the material presented in this report \dots\citep{greenwade93}

\section{Main Body}
One or more sections covering your research topic.

Here you should include appropriate figures and code snippets to illustrate your discussion. Ensure that all figures and code snippets are properly explained in your text.

Where text, figures or code snippets are copied from another source, the source must be clearly acknowledged. Copied text must be surrounded by quotation marks "..." to show clearly that it is copied. 

\section{Conclusion}
Here I would like you to discuss how the issues raised in your report will affect your processor design. Where you have seen different processors opting for different solutions to the same problem you should discuss their relative merits in the context of your design.
