This is the coding scheme I used when writing up the instruction set.

OpCodes:
Shifting starts 000
Addition starts 001
Subtraction starts 01 (01110, 01111 not used)
Logic starts 10 (10110, 10111 not used)
Type B instructions start 110
Others (E,C,D) start 111

Can set opcode of type D to 1111, allowing 4 bits for branch type selection (Not implemented)

Conditions:
Unconditional starts 0
	a 0 next uses link register
	a 1 next does not use link register
Conditional starts 1
	a 1 next checks z flag
	a 0 next does not check z flag
