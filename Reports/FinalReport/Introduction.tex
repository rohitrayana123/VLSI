This report documents the design and test of the \textsc{Samurai} processor. 
The processor was designed for the ELEC6027: VLSI design module by Team R4.

The report is broken down into four main sections.
Firstly, the overall design of the architecture and instruction set are discussed. 
The design of the processor, including all datapath modules and the behavioural model for the controller, is then discussed.
This includes state machines and circuit diagrams where applicable. 
Following the design, the testing is documented. 
This includes descriptions of the tests conducted on all designed modules. 
Finally, the report concludes.
