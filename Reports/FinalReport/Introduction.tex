This report documents the design and test of the \textsc{Samurai} processor. 
It was designed for the ELEC6027: VLSI design module by Team R4.

The report is broken down into four main sections.
%Firstly, the overall design of the architecture and instruction set are discussed. 
Firstly, the overall design of the architecture and datapath hardware is discussed. 
This is followed by the instruction set considerations and machine code formatting choices. 
The design of the processor, including all datapath modules and the behavioural model for the controller, is then discussed.
This includes state machines and circuit diagrams where applicable. 
%Following the design, the testing is documented. 
Following the design, testing strategies are explained and discussed. 
This includes descriptions of the tests conducted on all designed modules. 
%Finally, the report concludes. 
Finally, the report evaluates the success of the final design with some concluding remarks. 

A comprehensive list of instructions, testing results and project management considerations are also included in the appendix.
Along with a division of labour form.
