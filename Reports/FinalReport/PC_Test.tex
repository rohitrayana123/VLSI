This module contains both the program counter and link register, which could be tested independently by checking the response to different select signals. The PC was tested by setting \textit{PcSel} to each possible value, then causing a change in the value of that input to ensure the value of PC reflects the change. This covers incrementing, \textit{SysBus}, \textit{AluOut} and constant inputs. 
\todo[inline]{Extend tests for load from LR}

The link register was then tested in the same manner for loading from \textit{SysBus} and an incremented program counter value. 
The value of each register was read from the system bus with assertions to ensure correct behaviour.
