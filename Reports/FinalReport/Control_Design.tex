\section{Controller}

The controller is a Mealy machine used to sequence operations performed on the datapath.
Figure~\ref{fig:ControlBlock} contains all inputs, outputs and internal registers.
There are $7$ labelled inputs including two $4$ bit buses and one $8$ bit bus.
There are $26$ labelled outputs including five $4$ bit buses and one $3$ bit bus.
Typedefs, defined in a global file, are used for some single bit outputs and all bus outputs to keep decoding consistent in control and the datapath.

Three main states exist to service the fetch, execute and interrupt stages.
Five sub states are used within the main states to further coordinate operation.
The ASM chart in figure~\ref{fig:MainStateASM} describes state changes using the sub state, opcode and interrupt request signal.   
When \textbf{nReset} is asserted the machine will return to the first cycle of the fetch state.

Synthesis and layout - I/O config, magic vs Ledit maybe?
