Firstly, I regard the project as a success. 
We managed to work together and communicate to produce a functional processor. 
All members got on well with each other on a whole and no social issues were encountered. 
As MW, AJR and myself have all worked together previously, which helped going into this project.
The regular meetings also helped keep everyone informed. 
There were no issues wtih who was meant to be handing work in, or what people were doing.


I think it was difficult for ARR to join our group as MW, AJR and myself were all good friends. 
There was a skill and motivation divide which I noticed early on in the project. 
Initially, work was allocated evenly amongst the group. 
Work from ARR was often of a lower standard than other members. 
In the early stages, help was given to ARR by other members. 
However, as the project progressed with no change, less important work was given to ARR due to the time pressures and necessity to fix work done. 


In hindsight, the pursuit of the interrupts was probably too much for a small group. 
I was cautious to allow development of this at the time, but agreed to give it an attempt. 
AJR and myself conducted the work needed.
As we got it functional, and were the only team to do so, this encouraged us to keep the functionality. 
However, this probably distracted us from other issues in our processor, such as the speed and size. 
If we had more time, I would have given ARR more work to help her learn, and I potentially was a little impatient as my expectations may have been too high. 
Nonetheless, I have learnt a lot about project management from doing this project. 
It's been an enjoyable project and the end result is something I am proud of.
