In my opinion the project design proposed and undertaken was realistically acheivable within the time-scale provided for a standard size group of 5 members. 
The lack of one member would not however create a significant impact. 
While a team of three I felt would put too much pressure on us to maintain a comparable level to other groups. 
Due to ARR not being a fourth year student like the rest of us, she was not capable of as much. 
While she also appeared to lack the motivation to learn new skills, and contribute enough to the project. 
The addition of interrupts was also implemented in an ad-hoc manner.
Which with a dedicated role would have enabled a much more seamless design to be implemented. 
Overall the project progressed well but could have benefited more with greater manpower to spread the workload and allow for more design optimisations.
