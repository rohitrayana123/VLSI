\section{Group formation}

The group initially contained five students. 
At the start of the project, two of the original students left the group: one to leave to join another team, and one dropped the module.
This left the group with three members - AJR, MW and HL. 
Discussions were then undertook as to if the group wanted / needed a fourth member. 
As the group could not come to a unanimous decision, one for a fourth member, one against and one who was happy either way, Iain's advice for having a fourth member was taken. 

Instead of the original member
