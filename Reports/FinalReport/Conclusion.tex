The processor designed is a 16 bit RISC architecture.
The layout is fully complete and design rule checked.

Each module has been individually tested and verified.
However, there is a discrepancy between the Verilog behavioural model and the extracted layout.
In the test programs, this discrepancy was not noticed. 
It is not known if the bug exists in the layout or the Verilog.

Appendix~\ref{ch:pm} discusses the workings of the group and the project management.
This is rounded off with individual reflections from group members.
Appendix~\ref{ch:dol} shows the overall Division of Labour within the group for the entire project.

Overall, the project has been a success. 
The processor is functional and includes advanced features such as interrupts.
Given the size of the group, the level of functionality gained and the progress made is higher than the original expectations of the group.
