\section{Introduction}


This is the Programmers Guide for the processor designed by Team R4 in the VLSI Design Project, ELEC6027. 

The processor is called \samurai{} - \textbf{S}ixteen bit \textbf{A}RM and \textbf{M}IPS \textbf{U}nified \textbf{R}ISC \textbf{A}rchitecture with \textbf{I}nterrupts.
It is a sixteen bit general purpose Von Neumann processor. 
\samurai{} implements a custom Instruction Set. 

This guide documents the architecture and instruction set. 
In addition, four example programs are given along with instructions of the use of the Assembler. 
Finally, the simulation environment is explained, giving examples of how to run a program.
