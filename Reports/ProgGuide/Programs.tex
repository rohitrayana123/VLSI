\section{Programs}
Every example program in this section uses $R7$ as a stack pointer which is initialised to the by the program to $0x07D0$ using the $LUI$ and $LLI$ instructions.
It is possible a stack is not required in which case no initialisation is needed and $R7$ can be used as a general purpose register. 

\subsection{Multiply}
The code for the multiply program is held in appendix~\ref{sec:multiply} listing~\ref{lst:multiply.asm}.
Capable of performing multiplication of two unsigned eight bit numbers to produce a single sixteen bit output.
The eight bit numbers are read from the sixteen input switches and then split in to lower and upper bytes which are then multiplied.
The resulting sixteen bit word is placed upon the LEDs before reaching a terminating loop.
A shift and add algorithm is implemented and a trade of between code size and execution time is made by loop unrolling the sixteen stages.

The algorithm is described using C in listing~\ref{lst:shiftAndAdd.c}.
In the every loop the state of the lowest bit in the multiplier byte controls the accumulator.
The multiplier is shifted right and the quotient is shifted left (multiplied by two).
