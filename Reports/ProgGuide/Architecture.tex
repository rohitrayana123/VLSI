\subsection{Architecture}

Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} shows the datapath architecture of the \samurai{} processor. 
The controller has been omitted along with all control signals. 
The exception is the status register is shown for data flow as this utilises the System Bus. 
Instruction decoding is also not shown for clarity. 
All registers, buses and multiplexors are 16 bits in length unless otherwise stated.
