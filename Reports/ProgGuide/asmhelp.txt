               4 (Added SP symbol)
               5 (NOP support added, help added)
               6 (Interrupt support added [ENAI, DISI, RETI])
               7 (Checks for duplicate Labels)
               8 (Support for any ISR location & automated startup code entry)
               9 (Support for .define)
              10 (Changed usage)

Registers: R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7==SP
Branching: Only Symbolic Supported

Notes:
       Input files are assumed to end with a .asm extension
       Immediate value sizes are checked
       Instruction-less lines allowed
       .ISR may be located anywhere in file
       .define may be located anywhere, definition valid from location in file onwards, may replace existing definitions
	 Error message line numbers are prefixed with f for assembly file and p for preprocessed code
